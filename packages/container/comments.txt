FYI: S3 buckets do not have Folders!!!

We will hold .js and .html files in Amazon S3.
Then will setup a Amazon CloudFront (CDN) distribution. A distribution is a set of files that we want to share with outside world. Here we will pull these files from S3 bucket.
So when we issue a request from browser, it will go to Amazon CloudFront. Then CloudFront
will talk to S3 bucket where files are saved and serve from there.

Services - search S3
1. Create Amazon S3 bucket
2. Since the bucket is secure it does not allow any public access.
3. To allow our bucket files to be shared online thru CloudFront, change propteries:
  a.  Static Web Hosting:
        index document: index.html
          Save changes
  b.  Permissions
        Block public access:
          Edit: Block all public access - Uncheck this.
            Save changes. (Ignore warnings, we want files in bucket to be available online)
  c.  Edit bucket policy -
        A policy is a set of rules that allows AWS services to communicate with each other.
        Policy generator: (opens in a new tab)
          Type: S3 bucket policy
          Principal: *
          Actions:
            Get Object - Select
            ARN (Amazon Resource Name): Copy from Edit Bucket Policy Tab.
              ARN should follow the following format: arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/<key_name>.
              Followed by /*
              So your ARN should be "arn:aws:s3:::mfe-dashboard-oi/*" VERY IMPORTANT add /*
            Click Add Statement

            Click Generate Policy --- Whatever JSON is generated copy it and paste it to the Edit bucket policy text area in previous tab.
            Save Changes.


Services - search CloudFront
Create Distribution:
1. Create a Web distribution.
  a. Domain name: Click and Select your bucket.
  b. Default Cache Behavior Settings - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  c. Distribution Settings
    SSL Certificate - Default CloudFront Certificate (*.cloudfront.net)
      [else if you have a domain name use Custom SSL Certificate]
  Click - Create Distribution

  Wait for Distribution status In Progress --> Deployed.
  Edit Distribution

    a. General -> Default Root Object - /container/latest/index.html
      - click Yes, Edit
    b. Error pages -> Create Custom Error Response.
      HTTP Error Code - 403 Forbidden
      Response Page Path - /container/latest/index.html
      HTTP Response Code - 200 OK
      Click - Create
      This is just saying on error return this custom html page.

      Note: In General Tab: We see the domain name: dny87fn2dfwm0.cloudfront.net

  Now to create the Github environment variables for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
  and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY we will first create a User using IAM service in Amazon console.
  Then create these variables there and then add to github environment variables.
  This will bridge the gap between github actions and Amazon S3 bucket.

  Services - search IAM
  Users - Create User
  a. User name - mfe-github-action
    Select: Programmatic Access.
    Next
    Permissions: Ideal is to create a policy to access only this s3 bucket but in interest of time and demo
    we will just select exiting policy.
    Attach existing policies directly
      - search s3 --> AmazonS3FullAccess (Select)
      - search cloudfront - CloudFrontFullAccess (Select)
      Next
      Tags (optional) - leave
      Create User.

  Got to github repo -- Secrets Add Secrets.
  Add the three secrets.
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: mfe-dashboard-oi,
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  These github secrets can only be accessed from github actions..

  Now on a push to master branch, the workflow will run and files will be copied to Amazon S3.
  If you access the domain name, you can see a blank page.
  In browser console there is an error that our main.js script file is not found.
  This is because it is accessing it like <domain>/main.js
  But in S3 the content is organised like
  container -> latest -> main.js
  So we will set Public Path in webpack prod config.
  publicPath: '/container/latest/'
  So all files which webpack will build, we need public path to be accessible. like our main.js. Now the webpack html plugin will take into account this public path when adding
  src for scripts inside the index.html file.
